1. 	OVERVIEW 

The first leg of OCEANUS 202 commenced on July 23, 1988 with departure from 
Reykjavik, Iceland at 10:12 A.M. GMT. The first station was located just 
offshore of southern Iceland at 63°19.7'N, 19°59.9'W to a depth of 195 meters. 
The first leg ended at Station 65 on August 6, 1988 at 33°18'N, 21°37'W. After a 
brief port stop in Funchal, Madeira, work resumed with a reoccupation of Station 
65 (at 32°51'N, 21°20'W) on August 11, 1988, and continued through Station 129 
on August 27, 1988.

Station spacing was generally 30 nautical miles from Stations 1 to 71 with the 
exception of reduced spacing over steep topography. Spacing from Stations 72 
to 112 was about 46 nautical miles. Spacing was the reduced across the equator. 
Stations 61, 62, 63, and 65 were repeated in order to complete the patchy 
vertical sampling resulting from a pylon problem, discussed below.

Each station consisted of a CTD/rosette cast to within 10 meters of the ocean 
bottom, with the exception of the repeated casts at Stations 61, 62, 63 and 65 
which were 1000 to 1500 meters. The rosette carried 24 4-liter bottles.

Ship navigation was either Loran-C (to about 50°N), GPS or transit-omega, the 
latter used only when GPS fixes were insufficient. Navigation was recorded on a 
SAIL loop and was networked to ODF's computer system where it was used for 
station positions and bathymetry. Bathymetry was recorded every five minutes 
from the OCEANUS' PGR.

An acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP) was operated throughout the first 
leg by Frederick Bingham of SIO. Water in the transducer well resulted in 
termination of ADCP acquisition on August 21. Scripps Shipboard Technical 
Support/Oceanographic Data Facility (ODF)ls/Neil Brown Mark 3 CTD #2, rosette 
frame and General Oceanics pylon were used throughout. A set of new 2.5 liter 
Niskin bottles were provided by John Bullister of WHOI; they were designed to 
minimize 0-ring contact with the sample water so that CFC samples would be as 
uncontaminated as those drawn from 10-liter bottles.

Bob Williams and Forrest Mansir of ODF provided the at-sea support of the ODF 
equipment. CTD data were acquired on an ODF deck unit and Integrated 
Solutions computer, audio backups were recorded on video tape. Frank 
Delahoyde of ODF provided the software support and shipboard CTD data 
processing. Salinity samples were analyzed on a Guildline autosalinometer by 
Forrest Mansir and Leonard Lopez of ODF. Oxygen samples were analyzed on 
the ODF's titration rig by Ron Patrick of ODF and Bob Williams. Nutrient samples 
were analyzed for NO3 NO2 PO4 and SiO3 on an Alpkem Rapid Flow Analyzer, by 
Joe Jennings from Oregon State University. The OSU and ODF computer 
systems were networked for data transfer and thus permitted complete 
preliminary data reports at various points during the cruise.

CFC samples were collected by John Bullister, Scott Doney, and Chris Johnston 
and were processed at sea. Tritium/helium samples were collected by Scott 
Doney for later processing by Bill Jenkins' group at WHOI. Because of the water 
demands when tritium/helium and CFC samples were both being drawn, oxygen 
samples were drawn from the copper helium tube rinse water.

Preliminary CTD data processing was carried out at sea during and after the 
casts. Subsets of CTD data comparable to the water samples were provided to 
the bottle data files immediately after each station in order to facilitate 
examination and quality control of the bottle data as the laboratory analyses 
were completed. It was discovered relatively quickly at sea that one of the ODF 
pylons was occasionally double-tripping and then skipping trips. This and other 
tripping problems were persistent on this expedition, perhaps partly because of 
the high profiling speeds and attendant stress on the terminations and slip 
rings. The effects on the final data are documented later in this report. 
(Appendices A and B).

2.	NISKIN BOTTLE DATA COLLECTION, ANALYSES, AND PROCESSING

After each rosette cast was brought on board, analysts drew water samples from 
each sampler for various parameters and recorded the water sample bottle 
assignment along with the Niskin sampler it was drawn from. STS/ODF data 
checking procedures included verification that the sample was assigned to the 
correct level This was accomplished by checking the raw data sheets, which 
included the raw data value and the water sample bottle, versus the sample log 
sheets. The raw data computer files were also checked for entry errors. 
Investigation of data included comparison of bottle salinity and oxygen with CTD 
data, and review of data plots of the station profile alone and compared to 
nearby stations.

If a data value did not either agree satisfactorily with the CTD or with other 
nearby data (for example in a plot comparison), analyst and sampling notes, 
plots, and nearby data were reviewed. If any problem was indicated the data 
value was flagged or deleted. (However, ODF preserves in its archives all bottle 
data values.)

Problems with the rosette pylon and electrical harness caused tripping problems. 
In most cases, ODF reports CTD data from scheduled bottle trip levels even 
when there might not have been a water sampler closure. This has been done to 
preserve a well-sampled discrete profile and hence better accommodate 
investigators who prefer using bottle data files exclusively. Other extra CTD 
levels were extracted from CTD data for purposes of reporting data at the 
deepest point. Because there is only a small separation between the deepest 
bottle and the deepest CTD level, we advise caution in use of this bottommost 
level if the data are interpolated. The repeated stations 61, 62, 63 and 65 
should not be merged as unacceptable offsets in most parameters results.

2.1.	Pressure and Temperature

All pressures and temperatures for the Niskin bottle data tabulations for 
Oceanus Cruise 202 were extracted from the processed CTD data, usually those 
from the corrected 10-second average bottle trip files collected during the up 
cast. (See below.) 

2.2. 	Salinity

Salinity samples were drawn into ODF citrate salinity bottles which were rinsed 
three times before filling. Salinity was determined after sample equilibration 
to laboratory temperature, usually within about 8-36 hours of collection. 
Salinity has been calculated according to the equations of the Practical 
Salinity Scale of 1978 (UNESCO, 1981) from the conductivity ratio determined 
from bottle samples analyzed (minimum of two recorded analyses per sample bottle 
after flushing) with a Guildline Autosal Model 8400A salinometer standardized 
against Wormley P-108 standard seawater, with at least one fresh vial opened per 
cast, or from the corrected CTD conductivity, temperature, and pressure.

Accuracy estimates of bottle salinities run at sea are usually better than 0.002 
psu relative to the specified batch of standard. Although laboratory precision 
of the Autosal can be as small as 0.0002 psu when running replicate samples 
under ideal conditions, at sea the expected precision is about 0.001 psu under 
normal conditions, with a stable lab temperature. Still, because a small droplet 
of fresh water, or the residue from a small evaporated droplet of seawater, can 
affect a bottle salinity in the third decimal place, and because the Autosal 
salinometer is sensitive to environmental fluctuations (such as experienced in 
the van borrowed for this expedition), salinities from bottle samples have a 
lower true precision under field conditions than in the laboratory. There was a 
problem with temperature control in the van where the salinity analysis 
occurred. Some of the missing bottle salinity values are attributed to this 
problems. ODF typically deleted the Niskin bottle salinity from this report, and 
substituted the corrected CTD salinity, whenever there was any question 
regarding its validity (See Appendix B).

2.3. 	Oxygen

Samples were collected for dissolved oxygen analyses soon after the rosette 
sampler was brought on board and after CFC and Helium were drawn. Nominal 
100 ml volume iodine flasks were rinsed carefully with minimal agitation, then 
filled via a drawing tube, and allowed to overflow for at least 2 flask volumes. 
Reagents were added to fix the oxygen before stoppering. The flasks were 
shaken twice; immediately, and after 20 minutes, to assure thorough dispersion 
of the Mn(OH)2 precipitate. The samples were analyzed within 4-36 hours.

Dissolved oxygen samples were titrated in the volume-calibrated iodine flasks 
with a 1 ml microburet, using the whole-bottle Winkler titration following the 
technique of Carpenter (1965). Standardizations were performed with 0.01N 
potassium iodate solutions prepared from pre-weighed potassium iodate crystals. 
Standards were run at the beginning of each session of analyses, which typically 
included from 1 to 3 stations. Several standards were made up and compared to 
assure that the results were reproducible, and to preclude basing the entire 
cruise on one standard, with the possibility of a weighing error. A correction 
(-0.014 ml/l) was made for the mount of oxygen added with the reagents. 
Combined reagent/seawater blanks were determined to account for oxidizing or 
reducing materials in the reagents, and for a nominal level of natural iodate 
(Brewer and Wong 1974) or other oxidizers/reducers in the seawater.

The quality of the KIO3 is the ultimate limitation on the accuracy of this 
methodology. The assay of the finest quality KIO3 available to ODF is 100%, 
±0.05%. The true limit in the quality of the bottle oxygen data probably lies in 
the practical limitations of the present sampling and analytical methodology, 
from the time the rosette bottle is closed through the calculation of oxygen 
concentration from titration data. Overall precision within a group of samples 
has been determined from replicates on numerous occasions, and for the system as 
employed on this expedition, one may expect ±0.1 to 0.2%. The overall accuracy 
of the data is estimated to be ±0.5%.

2.4. 	Nutrients

The following section was contributed by Lou Gordon of Oregon State University. 
Nutrient analyses were performed by Joe C. Jennings, Jr. and Lee Goodell of 
Oregon State University using an Alpkem Corp. Rapid Flow Analyzer, Model 
RFA-300 (RFA). The methods for silicic acid, nitrate plus nitrite and nitrite 
were those given in the Alpkem manual (Alpkem, 1987). The method for phosphate 
was an adaptation of OSU's hydrazine reduction method for the AutoAnalyzer-II 
(Atlas et al., 1971). The adaptation consisted of scaling reagent concentrations 
and pump tube sizes to duplicate final concentrations of reagents in the sample 
stream used with OSU's AutoAnalyzer-II phosphate method. All of these methods 
had been tested as implemented on the RFA-300 by comparison with an 
AutoAnalyzer-II simultaneously running OSU's existing AutoAnalyzer-II methods. 
The results were equal or better in all cases, with respect to accuracy, 
precision, linearity and interferences.

Sampling for nutrients followed that for the tracer gases, He, Tritium, CFCs, 
and dissolved oxygen. Samples were drawn into 30cc high density polyethylene, 
narrow mouth, screw-capped bottles. Then they were immediately introduced 
into the RFA sampler by pouring into 4cc polystyrene cups which fit the RFA 
sampler tray. Both the 30cc bottles and 4cc cups were rinsed three times with 
rinses of approximately one third their volume prior to filling. Analyses 
routinely were begun within twenty minutes after the 30cc bottles were filled 
and completed within an additional hour and a half. When the RFA malfunctioned, 
delays of up to several hours were experienced. If the delay was anticipated to 
be more than one half hour, the samples were refrigerated. Samples were 
refrigerated and stored up to 8 hours on stations 7-8. Station 13 was 
refrigerated for ca. 6 hours. All samples from stations 1-6 were irretrievably 
lost because of difficulties in starting up the RFA system at the beginning of 
the expedition.

During this cruise short-term precision was monitored by analyzing replicate 
samples taken from the same Niskin bottle and by taking replicate samples from 
Niskin bottles tripped at the same depth. Results from closely similar depths on 
the same station were also compared. The results are shown in Table I. It is 
emphasized that these data represent short-term precision, on order of minutes 
to an hour.

To check accuracy results were compared with historical data taken from the 
region. Selected, modern, high quality data sets were used for the comparison. 
The present data set compares within OSU's accuracy estimated from identified 
sources of error and estimates of their magnitude, i.e., silicic acid, 2%; 
phosphate, 1%; nitrate plus nitrite, 1%; and nitrite, 0.02 micromoles per liter. 
The fractional values are relative to the highest concentrations found in the 
regional water columns.

3. 	CTD DATA COLLECTION, ANALYSES, AND PROCESSING

CTD sensors and electronics have known response limitations in a dynamic 
marine environment. To the extent that the instrument responses are stable and 
repeatable, ODF and other groups can use an evolved set of sensor models, 
calibration procedures, and algorithms to correct the output of the instrument. 
ODF NBIS MkIII CTD data represents a successful application of these 
procedures, with the possible exception of the oxygen sensor data. It is 
possible under ideal circumstances to produce deep CTD data with an absolute 
accuracy of about 2 dbar, 0.002°C, and 0.002 psu. (Absolute accuracies are 
sometimes worse, especially in high gradient and/or high ship roll situations.) 

During ODF CTDO operations, pressure, temperature, conductivity, dissolved 
oxygen, elapsed time, altimeter, transmissometer and voltage signals were 
acquired from the underwater unit at a maximum frequency (i.e., for P, T, and C) 
of 25 Hz. The data were transmitted as an FSK signal which was demodulated 
by an ODF-designed deck unit. The deck unit output a 9600 baud RS-232C data 
stream. An Integrated Solutions UNIX workstation computer served as the real 
time data acquisition processor.

Data acquisition consisted of storing all raw binary data and also generating 
and storing a corrected and filtered 0.5-second average time series. (Audio data 
were recorded on video tape as an ultimate back-up.) An absolute value and 
first-order gradient single-frame filter was applied to each channel. For each 
0.5 seconds of data, a 4,2 sigma standard deviation filter was passed over each 
channel The remaining data for the 0.5 second block were then averaged. 
Conductivity was corrected for thermal and pressure effects. Pressure and 
conductivity were lagged to match the PRT temperature response. Pressure was 
corrected for thermal and pressure hysteresis effects. Data calculated in real 
time from this time series were reported and plotted during the cast. Also, an 
average of the time series data (usually 10 seconds) was calculated for each 
water sample collected during the data acquisition (these CTD values 
corresponding to rosette bottle closures were also be recomputed later when 
necessary). If required, a spike/drop-out filter was employed to remove 
remaining large pressure, temperature and conductivity spikes from the 0.5-
second time series data. (These were the type due to cable and slip ring noise, 
for example.) A ship-roll filter (disallowing pressure reversals) was used 
during the transformation of the data to a 2.0 dbar pressure series.

3.1 	CTD Laboratory Calibrations

The CTD pressure transducer was calibrated pre- and post-cruise in a 
temperature-controlled bath to the ODF Ruska deadweight-tester pressure 
standards. In the pressure calibration the mechanical hysteresis loading and 
unloading curves were measured pre-/post-cruise at 0.2/0.5°C to a maximum of 
8830 psi, and at 28.5/28.1°C to a maximum of 2030 psi. The transducer thermal 
response time is derived from the pressure response to a thermal step change 
from the high to the low bath temperatures. For high latitude work, the "high 
temperature" calibration is often performed at 5°C.

The CTD PRT temperature transducer was calibrated pre- and post-cruise in a 
temperature controlled bath with a NBLS ATB 1250 resistance bridge and a 
Rosemount standard platinum resistance thermometer which is checked frequently 
against the triple points of water and diphenyl ether. Seven or more calibration 
temperatures between 0 and 31°C were measured pre- and post-cruise. 

3.2. 	CTD Pressure Corrections

The dynamic response of the pressure sensor is typically quite different than 
the published specifications. Pressure error contributes inaccuracies to 
properties (especially salinity) calculated from pressure and other 
measurements. The pressure transducers used by ODF exhibit both a thermal 
response and a pressure hysteresis. These response characteristics are 
repeatable and can be corrected by a model based upon calibration experiments. 
Since this type of sensor is prone to a pressure hysteresis that is dependent 
upon the maximum loading pressure, the model utilizes a single loading pressure 
calibration and multiple unloading pressure calibrations (to various maximum 
pressures). The calibration is repeated at various calibration temperatures (see 
above). A lagged temperature (calculated from the CTD PRT sensor temperature) is 
used to model the internal transducer temperature, based upon thermal step 
change response calibration data. In this way ODF can produce final CTD 
pressures from the up and down casts accurate to 2 dbars. While this degree of 
accuracy is not critical per se to most oceanographers, it minimizes the effects 
of pressure errors on salinity calculations. 

Thermometric pressures were not measured on this expedition. The pre- and post-
cruise laboratory pressure calibrations were compared. Other than a small 
offset, which was automatically adjusted for each cast as the CTD entered the 
water, there was no remarkable difference between the two calibration results 
for CTD #2. The pre- and post-cruise calibrations agreed within 2.5 decibars, 
and there was no significant slope difference. No change was made to the 
shipboard CTD pressure data, to which the pre-cruise pressure calibrations had 
already been applied. Oceanus 202 pressures from stations with low ship roll are 
probably accurate to about ±3dbar, with some degradation probable at stations 
with high ship roll. 

3.3. 	CTD Temperature Corrections

CTD #2 had two PRTs. PRT #1 was the main temperature sensor and was used 
exclusively in all data processing. PRT #2 was a secondary temperature sensor 
installed to provide a check for the primary PRT. 

A comparison of the pre- and post-cruise laboratory PRT temperature transducer 
calibrations showed an average +0.0035°C shift for PRT #1. and an average 
+0.0030°C shift for PRT #2. There was a also very small slope difference between 
the two PRT #1 calibrations. There were no thermometric temperatures measured to 
check for drifts or shifts in the CTD temperature sensor during the cruise, and 
no remarkable instances of drift were observed. Bemuse there was far less 
scatter in the pre-cruise results, the pre-cruise calibration coefficients were 
used, plus an additional +0.002°C offset to balance out the pre-/post-cruise 
difference. 

While the PRT laboratory calibration is thought to be accurate to within 
±0.001°C Oceanus Cruise 202 temperatures in low gradient regions, i.e. where the 
CTD electronics have stabilized to the ambient water temperature and the 
response time errors are small, are probably accurate in absolute terms to about 
±0.002°C. 

3.4. 	CTD Conductivity Corrections

Check-sample conductivities were calculated from the battle salinities using 
corrected CTD pressures and temperatures. The differences between sample and CTD 
conductivities from pressures less than 1500 decibars were fit to CTD 
conductivity using a linear least-squares fit. Values greater than 2 standard 
deviations from the fit were rejected. The resulting conductivity correction 
slopes for each cast were fit to station number, giving a continuous smoothed 
conductivity slope correction as a function of station number. Conductivity 
differences were calculated for each cast after applying the preliminary 
conductivity slope corrections. Residual conductivity offsets were then 
calculated for each cast and fit to station number. The resulting smoothed 
offsets were then applied to the data. 

The conductivity sensor and/or electronics for CTD #2 displayed a sensitivity to 
pressure change beginning about 1500 decibars. This effect was better isolated 
by first applying the preliminary conductivity correction described above. After 
careful examination, it was determined that the problem began about 1350 
decibars, where the effect on conductivity was negligible. The distortion 
continuously increased to the cast bottom, where the effect was approximately 
0.03 mmhos/cm for a 6000-decibar cast. An additional first-order conductivity 
slope as a function of pressure was determined using deep conductivity 
differences:

	newC = oldC - 6.34e-6*pressure + (Coffset at 1350 decibars)

After applying this slope to the CTD data from 1350 decibars to the bottom of 
each cast, the conductivity slope as a function of conductivity and conductivity 
offset corrections were recalculated.

All depth ranges were used to determine the final conductivity slopes as a 
function of conductivity. The final smoothed slopes were determined in two 
groups, with the first 69 stations grouped together and the rest of the 
stations, with a constant slope, in the second group. Smoothed offsets were 
applied to each cast, then manually adjusted to account for discontinuous shifts 
in the conductivity transducer response, and/or to insure a consistent deep 
theta-S 
relationship from station to station.

The final bottle-CTD conductivity differences give the following results:

		mean conductivity	standard	# values
		difference (btl-CTD)	deviation	in mean
all pressures	-.00026 mmhos/cm	.00545		2956
allp (4,2rej)	-.00025 mmhos/cm	.00222		2775
press <= 1500	-.00009 mmhos/cm	.00685		1800
press >= 1500	-.00052 mmhos/cm	.00170		1156

("4,2rej" means a 4,2 standard-deviation rejection filter was used on the 
differences before generating the results).

3.5 	CTD Dissolved Oxygen Data

Dissolved oxygen data were acquired using a Sensormedics (Formerly Beckman) 
dissolved oxygen sensor. The same oxygen sensor was used during the entire 
cruise. Sufficient ( >12/cast) high-quality oxygen check samples were collected 
to make CTD oxygen calibration feasible.

CTD down-cast raw oxygen currents were extracted from the corrected pressure-
series data at isopycnals corresponding to the up-cast check-samples. The 
differences between CTD and check-sample dissolved oxygens were used to generate 
coefficients for a sensor model on a station-by-station basis. In the ODF 
software model of the response of the Beckman dissolved O2 sensor, filters are 
employed to correct for temperature and pressure response. The temperature at 
the surface of the sensor membrane is calculated and used to compute the 
diffusion time constant for the membrane. A diffusion time delay is also 
calculated. Pressure, temperature and salinity are found at the diffusion time 
and modeled to match the O2 response. Oxygen partial pressure is then calculated 
taking into account the dissolved O2 partial-pressure in atmospheres, the sensor 
current, the offset current of the sensor, the pressure at response-time, the 
pressure correction coefficient, the temperature correction coefficient, the 
temperature at response-time, the salinity at response-time, the salinity 
correction coefficient, the natural log of the slope of O2 conversion, and the 
offset of O2 conversion. Modeling coefficients are determined by applying a non-
linear fitting procedure to residual differences derived from Winkler titration 
check sample data.

The statistics below represent the final bottle-CTD oxygen differences: 

		mean oxygen	standard	# values
		diff.(btl-CTD)	deviation	in mean
all pressures	+.0009 ml/l	.0921		3037
allp (4,2rej)	+.0030 ml/l	.0371		2827
press <=1500	-.0001 ml/l	.1137		1874
press >=1500	+.0025 ml/l	.0366		1163

("4,2rej" means a 4,2 standard-deviation rejection filter was used on the 
differences before generating the results).

Several casts in this cruise did not have any bottle data for an extensive 
portion of the cast. Bottle oxygen values from nearby stations were matched up 
to those down-casts in order to ensure a reasonable data fit. The following 
casts were affected: station 61-63 cast 1 (used corresponding cast 2 oxygens for 
missing bottles above 1200 decibars), station 64 cast 1 (used station 63 cast 1 
bottle values between 3800 decibars and bottom), and station 127 cast 1 (used 
station 126 cast 1 bottles, where reasonable, above 3800 decibars). These added 
bottle differences were included when generating the final statistics in the 
paragraph above.

The oxygen sensor often requires several seconds in the water before it is wet 
enough to respond properly; this is manifested as low oxygen values at the start 
of some casts. Flow-dependence problems occur when the lowering rate varies, or 
when the CTD is stopped, as at the cast bottom or bottle trips, where depletion 
of oxygen at the sensor causes lower oxygen readings. CTD down-cast oxygen data 
are typically better because of the more continuous lowering rate; any non-
bottom CTD stops observed in the down-trace data are documented in the CTD 
Processing Notes (Appendix A).

Several casts without bottom oxygen bottle values did not have an appropriate 
nearby-cast bottle to substitute. The bottom data of the CTD traces for such 
casts tend to wander a little in the low direction. This may happen on other 
casts because of slowing down the package for the bottom approach.

3.6. 	Additional Processing 

A software filter was used on half of the casts to remove various conductivity, 
temperature, or oxygen spiking problems. These spiking problems were due to 
signal reception problems caused by slip rings, pylon noise (numerous new end 
terminations and signal problems on this expedition) and ship-roll generated 
spiking not solved by the roll filter. Overall, less than 0.4% of the time-
series data in those casts were affected. Pressure did not require filtering. 
The down-cast (up-cast for Stations 10, 115, and 125) portion of each time-
series was then pressure-sequenced into 2-decibar pressure intervals. A ship-
roll filter was applied to disallow pressure reversals on every cast except 
station 11 cast 2: a 17 percent reduction in the number of missing data levels 
for this cast resulted from not using the filter.

Density inversions which still remain in high-gradient regions cannot be 
accounted for by a mis-match of pressure, temperature and conductivity sensor 
response. Detailed examination of the raw data shows significant miring 
occurring in these areas as a consequence of ship roll. The ship-roll filter 
resulted in a reduction in the amount and/or size of density inversions.

Several shipboard time-series data sets had problems with large areas of missing 
or noisy data. Many of these casts were partially or fully recovered by re-
digitizing the raw signal from analog tape. Those casts which could not be fully 
recovered by filtering or re-digitizing are documented in the CTD Processing 
Notes (Appendix A). All other remaining problems are documented in the inventory 
as well.

3.7. 	General Comments/Problems 

There is one pressure-sequenced CTD- data set, to near the ocean floor, for each 
of 129 stations, numbered 1 through 129. There were also 4 stations - 61, 62, 
63, and 65 - which had two casts (deep and shallow) in order to recover 
shallower bottle data information missed on the deep casts because of rosette 
malfunctions, there were two shakedown stations, and there was one aborted cast, 
for a total of 136 CTD casts. The first three of the two cast stations were 
collected during re-occupations of the stations (about 22 hours later). These 
four shallower casts were originally given a cast number of 11 but are now 
called cast 2. The aborted cast was carried out at Station 11, and another CTD 
cast was done immediately afterward at the same location (and called cast 2). 
The data from the shakedown stations are not included in any distributions of 
the data.

The data reported are all from down-casts with the exception of stations 10, 115 
and 125 (all cast 1), which are up-casts. The up-cast was used for Station 10 
cast 1 because the down-cast had significantly more noise/gaps than the up-cast. 
Station 115 cast 1 down-cast had one large 280-decibar data gap, and the up-cast 
was fine. Station 125 cast 1 down-cast had several large data gaps (40-300+ 
decibars) which were not recoverable from analog tape, the up-cast was recovered 
with no gaps and without the signal-noise problems experienced shipboard.

Other casts with notable problems are as follows: Station 10 cast 1 up-cast, 
although better than the down-cast, has 1% missing data; its largest 
interpolated gap is 5 consecutive levels. Station 35 cast 1 down-cast was 
recorded from 14 decibars in-the-water; the up-cast showed this area to be 
within a good mixed layer. The down-cast, with the surface levels extrapolated, 
was used because of the benefit of using down-casts for oxygen processing. 
Station 11 cast 2 had many gaps: 5% of its data, including one 50-decibar gap, 
were missing and interpolated. Its down-cast was used because the up-cast was 
just as bad. Station 112 cast 1 also had gapping problems: 4%of its data were 
missing and interpolated, much of it concentrated in one 110-decibar gap. In 
general, missing data levels have been extrapolated/interpolated. All pertinent 
comments/problems from shipboard and post-processing notes are documented in the 
CTD Processing Notes (Appendix A).

Most gaps in Oceanus 202 CTD data were caused by signal interruption between the 
CTD and shipboard equipment, i.e. from slip ring and/or end termination 
problems. When possible, missing data were recovered from the raw data 
(videotape) backup, i.e. when the problems were caused by deck unit 
maladjustment. Low recording volume on the video backup prevented data recovery 
for the Station 125 down cast.

The 0-decibar level of some casts was extrapolated using a quadratic fit through 
the next three deeper levels. Recorded surface values have been rejected only 
when it is fairly obvious that the drift is due to the sensors adjusting to the 
in-water transition; if there is any doubt or a possibility that the data is 
real, it is left alone. Extrapolated surface levels, as well as other single 
interpolated levels which fill in for missing data, are documented in the CTD 
Processing Notes. The interpolated levels for the three stations with multiple 
problems, mentioned above, are documented in the CTD Processing Notes (Appendix 
A).

During post-cruise conductivity data calibrations it was noticed that there was 
an apparent +0.002 conductivity offset in the deep data for some stations. This 
apparent offset appeared in both the down-casts and up-casts for the affected 
stations. A similar phenomenon has been noticed before in this and other CTDs 
where the raw conductivity value crosses from 32.768 to 32.767, that is, when 
the most significant bit in the 16 bit number is turned off. On some stations, a 
-0.002 shift back appears yet deeper, where the raw conductivity value crosses 
back over to 32.767 from the other direction. This problem indicates need for 
instrument service. It is most noticeable in Atlantic Ocean data because this 
particular conductivity "crossover" value typically occurs in deep water, where 
salinity is fairly stable over many hundreds of meters.

There were various winch, wire and rosette problems throughout the cruise. This 
resulted in numerous stops, pauses or yoyos during casts. Only the most 
significant of these have been noted. As mentioned above, these severe changes 
in the lowering rate can affect oxygen data in particular.

4. 	DATA TABLES AND PLOTS 

4.1. 	Station and Cast Description 

Latitudes and longitudes were read from the ship's navigation system. The "Start 
Up" time is the time (GMT) at the beginning of the CTD up cast. The bottom depth 
was read from the PGR, and corrected according to Carter Tables (Carter, 1980). 
The value (in meters) in the column "DAB" (Distance above bottom) was obtained 
from the PGR, unless the "Comments" column reports altimeter, as was the ocean 
depth. If one adds the reported distance above bottom to the maximum sampling 
depth (reported in the CTD data) to calculate the ocean depth, there is often a 
difference, due to the difference in method of measurement of maximum sampling 
depth versus ocean depth. Also note that the maximum sampling depth is 
calculated from the corrected CTD data since the deepest bottle may not have 
been closed at the deepest CTD sampling point. If less than 24 bottles were 
sampled, the number of samples taken are reported in the comments. The 
complementary programs are reported in the "Samples" column.

4.2.	Tabular Data, CTD and Niskin Bottle

Station numbers are consecutive from the beginning to end of the crime, without 
interruption, except for two unreported test stations. Cast numbers are 
consecutive at each station, including aborted casts. However, at stations 61, 
62, and 63, the second cast took place during reoccupations about 18 hours to 4 
days later. Meteorological data were collected by the shies officers and were 
copied from the Oceanus Bridge Log.

The headings in both the CTD data and NISKIN bottle data have been abbreviated 
to PRESS, TEMP, and O2 for pressure (decibars), temperature (degrees Celsius), 
and oxygen (milliliters per liter). In the CTD data listings, specific volume 
anomaly (centiliters/ton) was abbreviated SVA and calculated according to 
Millero et al. (1980) and Fofonoff et al. (1983), Dynamic Height (dynamic 
meters) to DYN HT, (Sverdrup et al, 1942), Sound Velocity (meter per second) to 
SVEL, (Chen and Millero, 1977), Vaisala Frequency (cycles per hour) to VAIS FREQ 
which uses a subroutine by Bob Millard modified by Lynne Talley to incorporate 
Gaussian weighting after formulation of Breck Owens and N. P. Fofonoff. In the 
bottle data listings, the headings have been abbreviated to O2 SAT, (Weiss, 
1970), SIO3, PO4, NO3, and NO2 for oxygen saturation (percent saturation), 
silicate, phosphate, nitrate, and nitrite (micromoles/liter), respectively. 
Density anomalies in sigma-notation follow the usual practice; e.g. sigma-theta 
(or sigma-0) is the potential density in kg/m3 referenced to pressure=0, from 
which 1000 has been subtracted. Potential temperature, theta, (degrees celsius) 
has been calculated according to Fofonoff (1977) and Bryden (1973) and depth 
(meters) by Saunders (1981) and Mantyla (1982-1983).

Throughout the battle data report alphabetic characters may be found in the 
tabular data. These characters have the following meaning.

	D	A salinity value, tormally (default) from a bottle sample, has been taken 
		from CTD records.

	U	A data value is suspect, although no obvious reason has been found.

Comments and investigation of these values are reported in Appendix B

4.3.	Station Plots

The hydrographic station plots provide a visualization of the data that is not 
possible from listings. For each station, the upper plots are CTD data, the 
lower two plots are bottle data.

4.4.	Vertical Sections

The vertical sections were contributed by Mizuki Tsuchiya and Lynne Talley and 
are being published by Tsuchiya, Talley and McCartney (1991). The potential 
temperature, salinity and potential density sections are based on CTD data. Note 
for the potential density section that sigma-theta is contoured on the 0-1500 
meter panel, while sigma2 is contoured from 0-3000 meters and sigma4 is 
contoured from 3000-6000 meters on the full-depth panel. The oxygen, silica, 
nitrate and phosphate sections are band on discrete data; the CTD profiles were 
used to resolve some difficulties in contouring oxygen.

A16N (OC202) CHLOROFLUOROCARBON ANALYSIS METHODS
John Bullister (bullister@pmel.noaa.gov)

Specially designed 2 liter water sample bottles were used on the cruise
to reduce CFC contamination.  These bottles have a modified end-cap
design to minimize the contact of the water sample with the end-cap
O-rings after closing.  The O-rings used in these water sample bottles
were vacuum-baked prior to the first station. Stainless steel springs
covered with an epoxy powder coat were used inside the bottles (instead
of elastic tubing) used close the bottles.

Water samples for CFC analysis were usually the first samples collected
from the 2 liter bottles.  Care was taken to co-ordinate the sampling
of CFCs with other samples to minimize the time between the initial
opening of each bottle and the completion of sample drawing.  In most
cases, dissolved oxygen, helium/tritium and nutrient samples were
collected within several minutes of the initial opening of each
bottle.  To minimize contact with air, the CFC samples were drawn
directly through the stopcocks of the 2 liter bottles into 100 ml
precision glass syringes equipped with 2-way metal stopcocks.  The
syringes were immersed in a holding tank of clean surface seawater
until analyses.

For air sampling, a ~100 meter length of 3/8" OD Dekaron tubing was run
from the analytical system to the bow of the ship.  Air was sucked
through this line using an Air Cadet pump.  The air was compressed in
the pump, with the downstream pressure held at about 1.5 atm using a
back-pressure regulator.  A tee allowed a flow (~100 cc/min) of the
compressed air to be directed to the gas sample valves, while the bulk
flow of the air (>7 liter/minute) was vented through the back pressure
regulator.

Concentrations of CFC-11 and CFC-12 in air samples, seawater and gas
standards on the cruise were measured by shipboard electron capture gas
chromatography (EC-GC), using the techniques described by Bullister and
Weiss (1988).  For seawater analyses, a ~30-ml aliquot of seawater from
the glass syringe was transferred into the glass sparging chamber.  The
dissolved CFCs in the seawater sample were extracted by passing a
supply of CFC-free purge gas through the sparging chamber for a period
of 4 minutes at ~70 cc/min.  Water vapor was removed from the purge gas
while passing through a short tube of magnesium perchlorate desiccant.
The sample gases were concentrated on a cold-trap consisting of a
2-inch section of 1/8-inch stainless steel tubing packed with Porasil C
(80-100 mesh) backed by a 2 inch section packed with Porapak T (80-100
mesh) immersed in a bath of isopropanol held at -20 degrees C.  After 4
minutes of purging the seawater sample, the sparging chamber was closed
and the trap isolated.  The dewer full of cold isopropanol was removed
and the trap was submerged into a dewar of boiling water.  The sample
gases held in the trap were then injected onto a precolumn (12 inches
of 1/8-inch O.D. stainless steel tubing packed with 80-100 mesh
Porasil C, held at 90 degrees C), for the initial separation of the
CFCs and other rapidly eluting gases from more slowly eluting
compounds.  The CFCs then passed into the main analytical column (10
feet, 1/8-inch stainless steel tubing packed with Porasil C 80-100
mesh, held at 90 degrees C), and then into the EC detector.

The CFC analytical system was calibrated frequently using standard gas
of known CFC composition.  Gas sample loops of known volume were
thoroughly flushed with standard gas and injected into the system.  The
temperature and pressure were recorded so that the amount of gas
injected could be calculated.  The procedures used to transfer the
standard gas to the trap, precolumn, main chromatographic column and EC
detector were similar to those used for analyzing water samples.  Two
sizes of gas sample loops were present in the analytical system.
Multiple injections of these loop volumes could be done to allow the
system to be calibrated over a relatively wide range of CFC
concentrations.  Air samples and system blanks (injections of loops of
CFC-free gas) were injected and analyzed in a similar manner.  The
typical analysis time for seawater, air, standard and blank samples was
about 8 minutes.

Concentrations of CFC-11 and CFC-12 in air, seawater samples and gas
standards are reported relative to the SIO93 calibration scale
(Cunnold, et. al., 1994).  CFC concentrations in air and standard gas
are reported in units of mole fraction CFC in dry gas, and are
typically in the parts-per-trillion (ppt) range.  Dissolved CFC
concentrations are given in units of picomoles of CFC per kg seawater
(pmol/kg).  CFC concentrations in air and seawater samples were
determined by fitting their chromatographic peak areas to multi-point
calibration curves, generated by injecting multiple sample loops of gas
from a CFC working standard (cylinder 9944) into the analytical
instrument.  The concentrations of CFC-11 and CFC-12 in this working
standard were calibrated before and after the cruise versus a primary
standard (36743) (Bullister, 1984).  No measurable drift in the
concentrations of CFC-11 and CFC-12 in the working standard could be
detected during this interval.  Full range calibration curves were run
at intervals of ~ 3 days during the cruise.  Single injections of a
fixed volume of standard gas at one atmosphere were run much more
frequently (at intervals of 1 to 2 hours) to monitor short term changes
in detector sensitivity.

The small volume (~2 liter) water sampling bottles were designed and
constructed prior to this cruise because of the small rosette package
used.  The inner surfaces of the bottles may not have had adequate time
to desorb any excess levels of CFCs present in the PVC pipe used to
construct the bottles, and this may have contributed to the relatively
high and variable CFC-11 blanks observed in some samples.
CFC blanks were estimated from samples collected in regions where low
or CFC-free water was expected.  Measured CFC-12 concentrations were
consistently low and near the detection limit for depths between
2000-4000 meters from 30N -14N, and these samples were used to
estimate the mean CFC blanks for the expedition.  A CFC-12 blank
correction of 0.001 pmol/kg was applied to the entire cruise.  The
CFC-11 blanks were higher and more variable with an average of ~0.06
pmol/kg (see listing of replicate samples given at the end of this
report).  In some cases, applying these blank corrections to low
concentration samples yields negative reported concentrations.

On this expedition, we estimate precisions (1 standard deviation) to be
the greater of about 0.018 pmol/kg or 1.8% for dissolved CFC-11 and
0.004 pmol/kg or 1.5% for CFC-12.

A number of water samples had clearly anomolous CFC-11 and/or CFC-12
concentrations relative to adjacent samples.  These anomolous samples
appeared to occur more or less randomly during the cruise, and were not
clearly associated with other features in the water column (eg.
elevated oxygen concentrations, salinity or temperature features,
etc.).  This suggests that the high values were due to individual,
isolated low-level CFC contamination events. These samples are included 
in this report and are give a quality flag of either 3 (questionable 
measurement) or 4 (bad measurement).  A total of ~116 analyses of CFC-11 
were assigned a flag of 3 and ~46 analyses of CFC-12 were assigned a flag 
of 3. A total of ~112 analyses of CFC-11 were assigned a flag of 4 and ~89 
CFC-12 samples assigned a flag of 4.

In addition to the file of mean CFC concentrations reported for each
water sample in the data tables (keyed to the unique station: sample
ID), tables of the following are included in this report:

APPENDIX B Remarks for deleted or missing samples from OCEANUS 202 (MCTT).

Investigation of data may include comparison of bottle salinity and oxygen with 
CTD data, review of data plots of station profile and adjoining stations. CTD 
data is reported instead of bottle salinity when the comments refer to deleted 
salinity samples or no samples. There was a problem with the shies wire which 
caused many of the tripping problems. There was also a problem with temperature 
control in the van where the salinity analysis occurred. This caused many of the 
problems with salinity. Extra levels may occur for each station. These levels 
were extracted from CTD data for purposes of reporting deepest sampling level.

Station 001

106-17		Sample log: No salinity or oxygen per sampling schedule. 
		Duplicates @ 120db include water samples; therefore CTD trip 
		information for these 12 bottles deleted. No nutrients or 
		freon sampled.
119		delta-S .006 @ 120db, sample high as compared with duplicate 
		samples. Oxygen agrees with CTD and duplicates. Suspect 
		salinity problem with drawing or analysis. Delete salinity 
		sample (35.139).
120		Sample log: No salinity or oxygen per sampling schedule. 
		Duplicates @ 120db that include water samples; therefore CTD 
		trip information deleted. No nutrients or freon sampled.
Station 003

102		Sample log: Not closed, no water. Level not included in data tables, 
		not necessary duplicate @8db.
119		delta-S @820db is .059. Salinity was 35.110, salt bottle #3813. Oxygen 
		fits station profile. Bottle could have leaked, salinity and oxygen 
		value could fit higher in the water column, but for now, will assume 
		that there was only a problem with salinity. Delete salinity value.
Station 004

117		delta-S @810db is .060. Salinity was 35.065, salt bottle #3636. 
		Appears to be a sampling error, value close to shallower 
		level. Oxygen agrees with station profile- Delete salinity 
		value leave oxygen 
124		Sample log: Bottle drained before salinity was sampled. CTD 
		salinity @ 1246db reported.
Station 005

122		delta-S @ 1293db is .0060. Salinity is 34.993; salt bottle 
		#3526. The first inclination was to leave salinity data; 
		there are salinity changes reflected in CTD data. Salinity @ 
		1293db shows slight deviation from the distribution at 
		adjoining stations. - M. Tsuchiya. After further review and 
		from the comments by M. Tsuchiya; delete salinity value.
Station 007

101-08		Sample log: Tripping problems, no water samples. CTD 
		data reported to augment temperature and salinity profile.

		@506db, level not necessary.
112		Salinity (34.962) @ 1063db deleted because of CTD 
		difference.
113		delta-S @ 1214db is .0057. Salt bottle #3327. Oxygen looks good. 
		Delete salinity (34.926).
114		Salinity (34.931) @ 1366db deleted because of CTD 
		difference.
117		Salinity (34.928) @ 1820db deleted because of CTD 
		difference.
Station 011

201-12		No water samples taken. CTD data reported from surface to 
		407db to augment temperature and salinity profile.
202		Delete duplicate CTD data @ 106db.
213		delta-S @506db is .0108. Salt bottle #e76. Duplicate trip at 
		this level which agrees with CTD data. Other parameters 
		agree well with duplicates. Delete bottle salinity (35.093).
Station 013

108		Sample log: Bottom O-ring pinched, leaky pushed back in to 
		sample. Short salt Salinity and oxygen @508db fits station 
		profile. Oxygen a little low compared with adjacent 
		stations. Principal Investigator (L.T.) deleted nutrients. 
		Footnote salinity and oxygen uncertain.
Station 015

119		Oxygen: Ship roll got sample. No oxygen sample @ 1111db.

Station 017

119		Sample log: Bottle dry, no samples. CTD data reported @506db to 
		augment temperature and salinity profile.
Station 018

117		Sample log: Bottom lanyard from #18 caught. No water 
		samples. CTD data reported @699db to augment temperature and 
		salinity profile.
Station 019

103		No samples drawn, triplicate @9db therefore CTD data not 
		necessary.
Station 022

105-09		No water samples taken, duplicate trips @5db; therefore CTD 
		data not necessary.
Station 024

101		Sample log: Not closed. Duplicate trip @9db therefore CTD 
		data not necessary.
Station 025

122		delta-S @2317db is -.0175. All other parameters fit station 
		profile, suspect a sampling error. Delete bottle salinity 
		 (34.936).
Station 026

123		delta-S @2536db is -.0047. Salt bottle #3498. All other water 
		parameters agree with duplicate level. Delete bottle 
		salinity (34.950), suspect analysis problem. Analysts 
		indicated ship roll.

		problem. Delete bottle salinity.
Station 039

111		Salinity @840db is missing, no reason on salinity sheet.
Station 040

101		Sample log: Leaked when rosette was brought out of water. 
		Salinity was not drawn @5db; oxygen is reasonable.
107		delta-S @510db is -.0199. Salt bottle #3049. Suspect drawing 
		error. Delete bottle salinity (35.408).
124		delta-S @4610db is .0037. Salt bottle #3078. Suspect analysis 
		error. Delete bottle salinity (34.913).
Station 041

107		delta-S @300db is -.0193. Salt #48kk. Deviates from adjacent 
		station comparison. Delete bottle salinity (35.624).
Station 043

121		Salinity (34.957) deleted because of CTD difference. This 
		could have been a sampling error @ 3288db with # 19 @2760db.
122		Sample log: No water left for nutrients. No nutrient samples 
		@3609db.
Station 044

114		Salinity: Salt Bottle #16z leaky (removed). delta-S @ 1269db is 
		.0058. Delete bottle salinity (35.161).
