CRUISE DESCRIPTION

Leg 5 of SAVE (denoted Hydros 3 by Scripps) was carried out on the R/V 
Melville and was actually a combination of a meridional section across the 
Argentine Basin at 41°W and a short section perpendicular to the western 
boundary at about 35°S planned as part of SAVE, and the southern end of a 
meridional long line in the Atlantic Ocean planned by M. McCartney, L. Talley 
and M. Tsuchiya that extended from 32.5°S, 25°W to South Georgia Island.

The cruise departed from Capetown on January 23, 1989 at 1400.  The first 
station, a reoccupation of AJAX station 44 at 36°S, 1°E, was taken on January 
26.  Work began on the 25°W line on February 1 with station 237 taken at 
32°30'S, 25°00'W.  The southernmost station (278) just north of South Georgia 
Island was taken on February 17.  The station spacing was about 30nm along 
this line.  The section along 41°W (stations 279-304) was occupied between 
February 18 and March 2 with a station spacing of about 65nm.  The portion of 
the western boundary section outside Uruguay's 200 mile zone (stations 305-
308) was taken between March 4 and March 6.  Stations inside Uruguay's 
200mile zone were taken on the following leg when an Uruguayan observer was 
on board.  The cruise ended in Montevideo on March 8, one day later than 
scheduled.  The one-day delay was caused by a break down of the main engine, 
which was repaired at sea.

The total number of miles steamed was 5989 and the total number of CTD- 
rosette stations occupied was 73.  These stations were taken using a Neil 
Brown CTD interfaced to a Scripps Ocean Data Facility rosette equipped with 
thirty-six 10-liter bottles.  At 13 of the stations large volume samples were 
collected using Gerard barrels.  Generally 18 large volume samples were 
collected between the surface and the bottom.  The total steaming time for 
the cruise was 25 days, 15 hours and the total station time was 17 days, 5 
hours.  Originally, 81 stations had been planned, but 8 stations were dropped 
because of time lost during rough weather.  Approximately 1.25 days were lost 
because of slow steaming and greater time required to complete casts in rough 
weather and an equal amount of time was lost because of equipment failures 
during rough weather.  Most of the equipment failures were Gerard barrels not 
tripping properly and breaks in the CTD termination.

SHIPBOARD PROGRAMS

Samples collected and analyzed.  The core program consisted of XBT and CTD 
profiles; on board analysis of water samples for salinity, oxygen, nutrients 
(phosphate, nitrate, nitrite, silica), CFMs, total CO2, and pCO2; and 
collection of samples for shore based analysis for tritium, helium-3, carbon-
14, radium-228, radium-226, krypton-85, and argon-39.

Ancillary programs carried out on this leg were transmissometer profiles 
taken with the CTD profiles, on board analysis and collection of samples for 
shore based analysis for suspended particulate matter, and collection of 
samples for shore based analysis for barium, neodynium and total CO2.  Also 
air samples were collected for C-13 and C-14 measurements in methane.

Rosette sampling

Ten-liter water samples were collected using a dual rosette system that held 
36 bottles (12 on an inner rosette and 24 on an outer rosette) interfaced to 
a CTD.  Sampling depths were determined after viewing temperature, salinity, 
density, oxygen, and percent transmission from the down cast.  Generally 36 
samples were collected with the bottom samples between 10 and 5m from the 
bottom.

Samples were drawn from the rosette using the following procedure.  A 
sampling director, nominally one of the co-chiefs, choreographed the draw 
sequence for all Niskin bottles, and recorded bottle numbers as samples were 
taken.  This was not simply a passive, recording-secretary role; but an 
interactive, real time scheduling process to minimize total gas sample draw 
time and maximize efficient use of personnel.  The sampling sequence was: a) 
CFMs, b) Helium-3, c) Oxygen, d) pCO2, e) TCO2, f) Tritium, g) Nutrients, h) 
Salinity, i) Suspended particulates.

However, only oxygen, nutrients and salts were drawn from all bottles on all 
stations.  On 3 stations, neodynium samples were collected after the salinity 
samples and on 5 stations, barium samples were drawn after salinity.  At two 
stations, vertical profiles of Keeling total CO2 samples were collected.  Two 
bottles were tripped at each depth where these samples were collected an 
additional rosette cast at these stations.  Keeling CO2 samples were also 
collected at the surface every 2.5 of latitude between 32.5°S, 25°W and South 
Georgia Island.

Sampling started with the bottom bottle (#36), 15-20 minutes after the 
rosette arrived on deck. On typical stations all gas sampling was completed 
within 1.5 hours of the time the first bottle was opened and all gas samples 
were usually drawn within 6 minutes after any particular bottle was opened.

Large Volume Sampling

Large volume samples (25Cl) were collected for carbon-14, radium-228, 
krypton-85, and argon-39.  These constituents were extracted from the water 
on board ship and returned to various shore based laboratories for analysis.  
The water was collected using Gerard barrels (one barrel per sample except 
for argon-39 which required 6).  Also barium samples were collected from the 
Niskin bottles attached to Gerard barrels.  Vertical profiles consisting of 
18 samples were obtained by performing two 9-barrel casts.  Normally, the 
deep cast would be performed first, followed by the CTD-rosette cast and the 
shallow Gerard cast.  When Ar-39 samples were collected, 6 Gerard barrels 
were hung with 10m spacing and lowered to the desired depth.

Underway/XBT Program

XBT casts were usually taken between CTD stations.  Where the station spacing 
was 30nm, one XBT was taken and for greater spacing 2 XBTs were taken.  The 
XBT casts were accompanied by water samples for dissolved oxygen, pCO2, 
salinity and nutrients taken from the Melville's clean seawater line.

Bathymetry

Depth was measured continuously along the entire cruise track using a 12KHz 
precision depth recorder.  The raw data was digitized by hand at 5minute 
intervals and a tape of the reduced data will be produced by the Geological 
Data Center at Scripps.

The number of the various types of samples collected is summarized in Table 1.

SOME HIGHLIGHTS

Station locations, and vertical sections of potential temperature, salinity, 
and oxygen along 41°W and between 32°30'S, 25°00'W and South Georgia Island 
are presented in another section of this report.

The Argentine Basin contains several of the oceans major water masses.  
Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) is observed in both sections as a 
salinity minimum.  This minimum occurs at about 900m at the northern end of 
the sections and shoals to the surface at about 50°S.

North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) is observed as a plume of high salinity, 
high oxygen, low CFM water extending southward in both sections centered at 
about 2700-3000m.  The NADW mixes with Circumpolar Water (CPW) at higher 
latitudes and the NADW characteristics are diminished.  However, the salinity 
and oxygen maximum and CFM minimum are observed as far as 50°S in the NADW-
CPW mixture.  The NADW characteristics are stronger in the 41°W section than 
the section ending at South Georgia Island indicating mixing between these 
two water masses as both flow eastward with the Circumpolar Current.

The densest water was observed behind the Falkland Ridge in the South Georgia 
Basin.  This water was cold (-0.15) with a low salinity (34.65- 34.66), high 
oxygen concentration (5.4-5.6ml/l) and high F-11 concentration (0.3-
0.4pmol/kg) and originated in the deep Weddell Sea.  Water with these 
characteristics, but less intense, was also observed north of the Falkland 
Ridge.  Along the 41°W section, cold, low salinity, high oxygen, high CFM 
water, intermediate in intensity between that observed to the south and the 
north of the Falkland Ridge, was observed tightly banked against the base of 
the Ewing Bank.  This indicated that this water entered the Argentine basin 
from the South Georgia Basin by flowing around the western end of the 
Falkland Ridge and then proceeded to flow westward along southern boundary of 
the Argentine Basin.  There was also a less intense version of this water 
further north.  The occurrence of this water north of the southern edge of 
the Argentine Basin and to the north of the Falkland Ridge is in agreement 
with data taken along 47°S on leg 4 which showed the coldest, lowest 
salinity, highest oxygen, highest CFM deep water to be on the eastern side of 
the section.  This indicates that deep water from the Weddell Sea also enters 
the Argentine Basin east of the Islas Orcadas Rise, but further analysis and 
perhaps more stations will be required to determine the specific route this 
water takes as it flows into the Argentine Basin.
